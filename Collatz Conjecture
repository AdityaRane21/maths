The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics that is easy to state but extremely hard to prove.

Take any positive integer n and repeat the following steps:
if number is odd - multiply it by 3 and add 1
if number is even - divide by 2

Conjecture:
No matter which positive integer you start with, the sequence will always eventually reach 1.

Example
Start with n = 6
6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

Start with n = 11
11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

For every positive integer at the end we will get a repeated sequence of 4 2 1

This problem is also known as :
Hailstone Sequence
Ulam Conjecture

Pseudocode:
while n != 1:
    if n is even:
        n = n / 2
    else:
        n = 3*n + 1
